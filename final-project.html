        <h2 class="topics">About</h2>
        <p>This is my <strong>first</strong> Epicodus project for our online class. <em>All past assignments</em> have been used a means to better our skillset in the art of coding. So far, the course has been active for 3 weeks and our task is to break down the knowledge we have learned thus far. In this site, I will be covering the things we have learned and demonstrate it through this site. Below is a list of the topics we have covered to date:</p>

                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Git</li>
                <li>GitHub Pages</li>
                <li>Terminal Commands</li>
                <li>Bootstrap</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2 class="topics">What's Next?</h2>
        <p>Next in our journey of coding, we will be learning JavaScript and jQuery. Unlike HTML and CSS, I do not have a background in these languages. My primary goal of this class is to cover this subject and get a firm grasp/understanding of how the language works and where it's applied. These two subject will be covered in the next three weeks of the course. In our final two weeks, we will be focused on Arrays and Looping. I am not sure what this will entail, but I can only be optimistic in the weeks to come.</p>
