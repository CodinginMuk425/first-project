#### Independent Project One for Epicodus, January 20th, 2020

#### By _**Ramy Carter**_

## Description

This is my first independent project that will be graded for my online Epicodus course. The site consists of a breakdown about the course as well as brief background of myself. The site includes the usage of HTML, CSS, Markdown, and GitHub pages. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Create a project folder & file
* Initiate a connection from VS to a GitHub repository
* Code content using HTML, CSS, & Markdown in the ReadMe file.
* Regularly commit and push changes made through the terminal
* Create and merge multiple branches & pages.

First you must create a folder and file on your machine. Once a folder and file are created through your terminal, you can begin coding. You will need to create a CSS folder and file to conect to your HTML file for styling the page. 

## Known Bugs

## Support and contact details
